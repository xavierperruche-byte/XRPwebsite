# The Art Of Gifting.
</br>

«Gorgeous madness», «The lemons of Sicily» and «The awakening of spring».

For the Zurich designer Manuela Menzi, the art of giving is something so special that it all starts with wrapping.

This was the Why of our collaboration. I do love to take my times to select the right wrapping papers depending of the person, the event, the season. It could be an anniversary, it could be Christmas Season, wrapping paper is unique and part of the gift.

Because the existing wrapping paper was too monotonous for Manuela, she started designing her own wrapping paper last year. Manuela Menzi provides more glamor on the gift table with her artistic wrapping paper.

The high-quality prints will make giving even better. It is a creative process. Then, let’s source it properly.

«I wanted paper to look like a small work of art and to make giving and receiving presents even more fun and delicately elegant.»
</br></br></br></br>
<b>COOL COLLAGES</b>

In her creations, she combines motifs from different style, from different worlds and culture. She is exploring various universes to share them with us. She may complete individual collages in a few days, others take months… A lot of patience and experimentations…

“I love working on a subject and trying out different things until I think it’s perfect.”

</br></br>

<b>PÄCKLI POETRY</b>

The Spring Summer 2023 collection includes designs with names like «Gorgeous madness», «The lemons of Sicily» and «The awakening of spring». The name says it all: With the compilation of carefully selected motifs, each sheet of paper tells a story.

The designs of the Fall Winter 2023-24 collection and the special edition are already ready and available on her website.

</br></br>
<b>MORE THAN GIFT WRAP</b>

The wrapping paper is printed in Europe on uncoated offset paper. The pleasant feel of the paper and the high-quality print are important to Manuela Menzi. Of course, the paper can also be used to line drawers or to enclose notebooks and books, or as an art print on the wall, as below.
